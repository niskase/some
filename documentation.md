## Django server initializing

```
pip install django                      # Installed Django server
django-admin startproject socialmedia   # Started "socialmedia" named project
python manage.py startapp posts         # Started "posts" named app under project (for posts)
```

Then I open settings.py and added "posts" to installed apps

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'posts',
]
```

which enables this posts app to main project

Also created [Post](socialmedia/posts/models.py) -model!

Then I just added the model to admin panel by registering the model in [admin.py](socialmedia/posts/admin.py)

Now post model is done and it works:
